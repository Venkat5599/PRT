Portal Canary takes a candidate runtime, forks Portaldot mainnet at its latest finalized block, upgrades the fork with `system.setCode`, and checks what happened to every real account. It also checks whether blocks kept coming, what changed in the runtime's interface, and whether the workflows people rely on still behave. Every run's files are hashed into one result, and that result is written to the V3 testnet as a `system.remark`. The run page re-checks the record in your browser, and one keyless script re-checks every run ever made.

```text
setCode accepted  ≠  blocks kept coming  ≠  every balance survived
```

An upgrade can pass the first two and still destroy money. Portal Canary checks all three.

## The 20-second pitch

A runtime upgrade on Portaldot is one `setCode` call. The chain accepts it, `spec_version` goes up, blocks keep coming, and nothing flags a migration that quietly rewrote balances. Portaldot mainnet also runs a 2021 runtime with metadata V13, which current Substrate tooling can't decode.

Portal Canary handles V13 and V14 with its own decoder, so it can read mainnet. It forks mainnet's real state into a local chain in under 15 seconds, applies the upgrade there, and diffs every account, the supply, the runtime's interface and five end-to-end workflows. The verdict comes with evidence, and the record is on-chain.

```text

Those nine addresses are real mainnet accounts holding deposits. The chain kept producing blocks and `setCode` reported success; the only signal was the money. Swap `halve-reserved` for `clean` and the same run passes with 0 accounts changed (runs `4be59393add6` and `a98bc8ba5969`).

`candidate` takes `clean`, `ed100x`, `fee10x`, `halve-reserved` or `source-60s`. You can also send `{"wasm_url":"https://…/runtime.compact.wasm"}`, or post a `.wasm` file as multipart. `"state":"dev"` runs on a fresh dev chain instead of mainnet state.

## Verify every claim in one command

[`scripts/verify-runs.sh`](scripts/verify-runs.sh) needs no key and no account. For every run on the `runs` release, it downloads the zip and checks each file against the sha256 that `result.json` lists. Then `canary verify` rebuilds the remark and finds it in the recorded V3 block.

```bash
cd backend && cargo build --release && cd .. && bash scripts/verify-runs.sh
```

The unrecorded rows stay in the list on purpose. Two (`1010`) ran while the record key held no tPOT. One (`1014`) clashed on a nonce with a run that finished at the same moment; the record step now retries, and the daily check is what caught it. The oldest runs predate on-chain records. `ed100x` shows why the workflows matter: its upgrade conserves supply, yet `balances.transfer.basic` breaks because a 1 POT transfer now falls under a 100 POT existential deposit.

## What Portal Canary is NOT

- **Not a test on mainnet.** Nothing is ever sent to mainnet. `canary upgrade` refuses any chain whose node reports a chain type other than Development or Local, and mainnet reports `Live`.
- **Not a byte-exact replay of mainnet's runtime.** The fork runs mainnet's storage on the dev node's runtime, because mainnet's 60-second BABE slots can't move to a single local authority. Mainnet's own runtime and the public source differ in constants, not storage layout (see Compare).
- **Not a metadata diff alone.** A diff tells you what changed. A run tells you what that change did to real balances and real workflows.
- **Not a promise you have to trust.** Every number on a run page comes from files whose hashes are recorded on-chain, and the script above re-checks them without a key.

## The problem I set out to solve

`setCode` accepts any runtime with the right `spec_name` and a higher `spec_version`. After that, the chain's own signals say the upgrade went fine: the extrinsic succeeds, the version goes up, blocks keep coming. A migration that halves every reserved balance and leaves `TotalIssuance` alone produces none of those signals. The supply just stops adding up.

Portaldot makes this harder. Mainnet runs a 2021 runtime with **metadata V13**, and current tooling decodes V14 and up, so the usual tools can't read mainnet at all. The V3 testnet runs V14. Comparing the two, or testing an upgrade against real mainnet state, needed a decoder for both and a way to get mainnet's state into a chain that would accept a `setCode` from us.

## What I built

- **Runs on mainnet state.** [`backend/driver/src/fork.ts`](backend/driver/src/fork.ts) copies mainnet at its latest finalized block into a dev chain spec: every pallet except consensus and block history, all 4,716 accounts, 186 balance entries, 3,726 staking entries, vesting and identities. It takes 4 to 15 seconds, so every run forks current mainnet.
- **A state diff across `setCode`.** `canary upgrade` reads every account and `TotalIssuance` at a pinned block before and after, waits for three blocks under the new runtime, and lists each account that changed.
- **A compatibility risk engine.** [`risk.rs`](backend/crates/canary-chain/src/risk.rs) judges each runtime difference by severity, with a reason and the before/after rows. The same Rust code runs in the CLI, in every run, and in the browser as WebAssembly.
- **Workflow tests on both sides.** Five YAML workflows ([`backend/tests/workflows`](backend/tests/workflows)) run as signed extrinsics on the baseline and the candidate, and every expectation is compared.
- **Proof.** `result.json` carries the sha256 of every other file. `canary attest` writes its hash to V3 as a remark, the run page re-checks it, and [`scripts/verify-runs.sh`](scripts/verify-runs.sh) re-checks all runs.
- **A daily check.** Every day `clean` must pass and `halve-reserved` must be caught, both on mainnet state. A failure opens a GitHub issue, and a pass closes it.
- **A dashboard** built on shadcn/ui: New run, Runs, run pages, Compare between any two nodes, an endpoint Doctor, the mainnet Supply invariant, the Registry contract, and On your node for running the suite against your own node with a wallet.

1. **Check inputs.** Run id, candidate name or https URL, and `state` (`mainnet` or `dev`).
2. **Get the candidate.** Built runtimes are checked against [`SHA256SUMS`](backend/runtimes/out/SHA256SUMS). An uploaded file or URL is fetched with a 16 MB cap.
3. **Start two chains.** On mainnet state, `fork.ts` writes `fork-meta.json` (block, hash, account count, issuance) and both nodes start from the same `fork.json` with `--no-mdns --reserved-only`, so they can't peer. On a fresh chain, accounts with reserved deposits are written in first, so a migration has something to break.
4. **Upgrade the baseline** to `clean`, so both sides run the same codebase and differ only in what the candidate changes.
5. **Upgrade the candidate**: before and after snapshots of every account and the supply, plus liveness over three blocks. Exit 1 means it found a problem; exit 2 means it could not decide.
6. **Compare** the two upgraded runtimes and judge the risks.
7. **Run the five workflows** on both chains.
8. **Write `result.json`** with exit codes, the starting state and the sha256 of every file.
9. **Record it on V3** with `canary attest`, retrying a nonce clash, then check it with `canary verify`.
10. **Keep the files** as `<id>.zip` on the `runs` release, which outlives the 30-day artifact.

## Where the guarantee is enforced

| Guarantee | Module | The test that covers it |
|---|---|---|
| A migration that destroys funds is Critical, whatever else passes | [`upgrade.rs`](backend/crates/canary-cli/src/upgrade.rs) | `halved_reserve_is_a_critical_regression` |
| Fees moving between accounts are not a false alarm | [`upgrade.rs`](backend/crates/canary-cli/src/upgrade.rs) | `fees_moving_between_accounts_conserve_supply` |
| A chain that was already out of balance is inconclusive, not blamed on the upgrade | [`upgrade.rs`](backend/crates/canary-cli/src/upgrade.rs) | `pre_existing_imbalance_is_inconclusive` |
| `setCode` is never sent to a live network | [`upgrade.rs`](backend/crates/canary-cli/src/upgrade.rs) | `set_code_only_on_dev_or_local_chains` |
| The mainnet fork conserves supply, and the injected migration is caught on real deposits | [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) `integration` | step "mainnet fork (real state, local authority)" |
| The page rebuilds the exact bytes the CLI records | [`runresult.ts`](frontend/lib/runresult.ts), [`attest.rs`](backend/crates/canary-cli/src/attest.rs) | `run_payload_from_result_json`; "run remark rebuilt in the page matches the CLI" |
| A run page shows a record only if the files, the result and the block agree | [`Proof.tsx`](frontend/components/dashboard/Proof.tsx) | "run page: verdict, risks and the on-chain record re-verified in the browser" |
| A runtime compared with itself has no changes and no risks | [`risk.rs`](backend/crates/canary-chain/src/risk.rs) | `identical_runtimes_have_no_risk`; "compare: a chain against itself has no changes and no risks" |
| Additions alone are never a risk | [`risk.rs`](backend/crates/canary-chain/src/risk.rs) | `additions_alone_carry_no_risk` |
| Live-chain runs on your node never fund an account with more than 5 tokens | [`tx.ts`](frontend/lib/tx/tx.ts) | "live-chain cap keeps only workflows that fit in 5 tokens per account" |
| The canary still catches what it exists for, every day | [`daily-check.yml`](.github/workflows/daily-check.yml) | the `halve-reserved` run must report funds destroyed |

## What the risk engine measures

Every difference between two runtimes goes through the rules in [`risk.rs`](backend/crates/canary-chain/src/risk.rs). Each risk has a severity, the reason, and the before/after rows it rests on, grouped per pallet.

| Severity | Rule | Fires when | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | `spec-name`, `spec-version` | `setCode` would refuse the runtime | `different_spec_name_cannot_be_applied`, `spec_version_must_increase` |
| Critical | `consensus-constant` | BABE epoch or slot, or the timestamp period, changes | `consensus_timing_is_critical` |
| Breaking | `call-encoding` | a pallet index, call index or signature changes, or a call or pallet is removed, without a `transaction_version` bump | `moved_call_without_tx_bump_is_breaking`, `pallet_index_and_removed_pallet_are_encoding_changes` |
| Needs migration | `storage-type`, `storage-removed` | a storage item changes type or disappears | `storage_type_change_needs_migration` |
| Behaviour change | `constant` | a constant changes value (`System.Version` excluded, it changes on every upgrade) | `runtime_version_constant_is_not_a_risk` |
| Client update | `event`, `error`, `runtime-api` | events or errors are removed or renumbered, or a runtime API is removed or re-versioned | `constants_events_errors_apis` |

```

V3 is a new chain, not an upgrade of mainnet: applied to mainnet it would halt block production and change every staking call's encoding.

## Engineering decisions & the traps that taught me something

- **Write a decoder instead of waiting for tooling.** Mainnet's V13 metadata is unreadable to current libraries, so `canary-chain` decodes V13 and V14 itself and speaks raw JSON-RPC and SCALE. That one decision is what lets Compare put mainnet and V3 side by side.
- **An empty chain can't fail a migration.** The first `halve-reserved` run passed. A fresh dev chain had no reserved balances, so halving them changed nothing. Runs now start from mainnet state, or write deposits into a fresh chain first. That passing run is still on the list (`a7ef3ef0a76f`).
- **Most of mainnet's state is one pallet nobody needs.** A full key scan reached 765,000 keys in 150 seconds and kept going. Almost all of it was `MerkleMountainRange`, two nodes per block. Skipping it and the other block-history pallets took the fork down to 8,723 keys and about 6 MB.
- **The library's paged-key call returned nothing on this node.** `getKeysPaged(prefix, n, undefined, at)` came back empty for every pallet, while the raw `state_getKeysPaged` with `null` worked. `fork.ts` talks raw JSON-RPC.
- **A fork must not elect validators it has no keys for.** Mainnet's staking state would plan an era from mainnet validators, whose session keys aren't on the fork, leaving no block author. `fork.ts` sets `Staking.ForceEra = ForceNone`. The dev epoch is 1,200 blocks, so no session rotates during a run.
- **The fork's supply has to add up before the test starts.** The dev signers are added to `System.Account`, and their balances to `TotalIssuance`. Otherwise every run would open with a broken invariant and blame the candidate.
- **Two runs signed with one key at the same moment.** The daily check's first run found it: V3 rejected the second record with `1014 Priority is too low`. The record step now retries after a short random wait.
- **`setCode` going through proves nothing.** The unmodified public source is accepted by the 6-second dev chain, and then block production stops for good with `Timestamp slot must match CurrentSlot`. That's why liveness is a check and slot timing is a Critical risk.
- **A root-level ignore rule hid two folders.** `.gitignore` had `runs/`, which silently ignored `frontend/app/api/runs/` and its route files. It's now `/runs/` and `/backend/runs/`.

## What's real vs pending — the honesty table

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| Runs fork mainnet's real state at its latest finalized block | real; every mainnet-state run's `fork-meta.json` names the block and hash |
| `halve-reserved` destroys 286.305 POT across 9 real accounts on mainnet state | real; runs `971a7223bf7b` and `bbbf22879a6a`, both recorded on V3 |
| Every recorded run verifies | real; 6 of 6 in the script output above |
| Every run is recorded on V3 | **no**: 11 of 17 kept runs aren't. 8 predate records, 2 ran while the key had no tPOT, and 1 clashed on a nonce before the retry existed |
| The fork runs mainnet's exact runtime | **no**: mainnet's storage, on the dev node's runtime and consensus. Mainnet's runtime and the public source differ in constants, not storage layout |
| Upgrades are tested on mainnet itself | **no, by design**: `setCode` is refused on any `Live` chain |
| The `injected` runtimes are Portaldot bugs | **no**: `ed100x`, `fee10x` and `halve-reserved` are test runtimes with labelled, committed patches |
| The daily check runs every day | scheduled; ran twice on 29 Oct 2026 (first failed on the nonce clash, second passed) |
| On your node runs the suite on your own node | real for a local dev node or a funded wallet on V3; the hosted site can't reach a node you don't run |
| The record key's balance | 10 tPOT funded on 29 Oct 2026; one record costs about 0.022 tPOT |

## Attack → test

| The abuse | The test that answers it |
|---|---|
| A migration halves deposits and leaves `TotalIssuance` alone | `halved_reserve_is_a_critical_regression`; the CI fork step; the daily check |
| A runtime that halts the chain once applied | liveness over three blocks (`source-60s`, run `c3d4e5f6a1b2`: halted); `consensus_timing_is_critical` |
| An edited result file after the run | `result.json` hashes every file and V3 holds `result.json`'s hash; "run page: verdict, risks and the on-chain record re-verified in the browser"; `scripts/verify-runs.sh` |
| A run page pointing at a remark from another chain | `canary verify` compares the genesis hash ("same chain (genesis hash)") |
| Pointing the dashboard at mainnet to upgrade it | `set_code_only_on_dev_or_local_chains`; mainnet reports `Live` |
| An http URL, a non-wasm file or a garbage endpoint | "compare: refuses bad input with a reason"; "new run: lists the built runtimes and refuses a non-wasm file"; 400s from `POST /api/runs` |
| A false alarm from fees moving between accounts | `fees_moving_between_accounts_conserve_supply` |
| A diff that cries wolf on additions | `additions_alone_carry_no_risk` |
| The canary itself silently stops catching bugs | the daily `halve-reserved` run must still report funds destroyed |
| Run results vanishing after 30 days | files kept on the `runs` release, read first by the API |

## Limitations

- The fork runs mainnet's state on the dev node's runtime and 6-second consensus. A bug that only shows under mainnet's exact runtime or its 60-second slots won't show here.
- Contract child tries aren't copied. Mainnet has no contracts today (`Contracts.ContractInfoOf` is empty), so nothing is missing yet.
- Runs need GitHub Actions and a token on the server, so the hosted dashboard starts runs only on this repository.
- On your node needs a node the browser can reach. The hosted page can't see a node behind someone else's firewall.
- Records cost tPOT. When the key runs out, runs still complete and the page says why the run wasn't recorded.

## Security

- **No mainnet writes.** The upgrade path refuses non-dev chains, and the fork's nodes take no peers (`--reserved-only --no-mdns`).
- **Secrets stay server-side.** `CANARY_GH_TOKEN` lives only in the Vercel function's environment. `CANARY_ATTEST_SEED` lives only in GitHub Actions secrets, `attestation.json` records the signer as `env`, and the seed never touches a file.
- **Uploads are checked.** Files must start with the WebAssembly or compressed-runtime magic, are capped at 4 MB, and are stored under the run's id. URLs must be https.
- **At most 3 runs at once** (`MAX_ACTIVE`), so a burst of requests can't queue unlimited Actions minutes or records.
- **The record key holds only what it spends.** It was funded with 10 tPOT, about 450 records.

| Secret | Where | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `CANARY_GH_TOKEN` | Vercel, server only | Actions read/write (start and read runs) and Contents read/write (store uploaded runtimes as release assets), on this repository only |
| `CANARY_ATTEST_SEED` | GitHub Actions | a V3 account with a little tPOT; it signs each run's record |

```

The site: `cd frontend && bun install && bun run dev`. Tests: `bun test tests`, then `bun run build && npx playwright test`.

## How I'd deploy it

The site is a Next.js app on Vercel with one server secret, `CANARY_GH_TOKEN`. The runs execute on GitHub Actions in this repository and need `CANARY_ATTEST_SEED` plus a few tPOT on that key. To run it for another repository, fork it, set both secrets, point `REPO` in [`frontend/lib/runs.ts`](frontend/lib/runs.ts) at the fork, and deploy `frontend/`. The daily check starts on its own schedule once the workflow file is on the default branch.

## Tests

115 passing: 41 Rust, 32 unit, 38 browser and 4 contract.

| Suite | Count | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `canary-chain` | 29 | decoder, diff, every risk rule |
| `canary-cli` | 10 | upgrade verdicts, the chain-type guard, the run record payload |
| `canary-wasm` | 2 | a bad request or undecodable metadata returns a named error, never a panic |
| Frontend unit (`bun test tests`) | 32 | landing markup, served reports, the page-built record matches the CLI, workflow funding cap, run titles |
| Browser (`npx playwright test`) | 38 | 19 tests on desktop and phone: every view, Compare on real nodes, refused input, Supply, Doctor, runs, a run's on-chain record, a mainnet-state run |
| Contract (`forge test`) | 4 | `CanaryRegistry` attest, duplicates, empty reports, clean status |

CI also runs the integration job against a real Portaldot dev node: doctor, compare against live mainnet, a determinism control, and the mainnet fork with the injected migration.

The Rust crates use `tungstenite`, `ureq`, `native-tls`, `blake2`, `sha2`, `twox-hash`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`, `clap`, `anyhow`, `hex` and `url`. The driver uses `@polkadot/api`, `@polkadot/keyring` and `@polkadot/util-crypto` (Apache-2.0).
